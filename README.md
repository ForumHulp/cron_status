Cron Status
===========

Cron Status displays an overview of Board's Cron Jobs in Maintenance module of ACP. This extension also shows a notification on the main page of ACP when a cron job is locked (optionally). It shows the time when the cron task started and which cron task was the problem.

## Requirements
* phpBB 3.1.0-dev or higher (phpBB 3.1.0-RC3 or higher for Cron Status Notice on ACP index)
* PHP 5.3.3 or higher

## Installation
You can install this extension on the latest copy of the develop branch ([phpBB 3.1-dev](https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3)) by doing the following:
